"""Monte Carlo season simulator built on the validated production model.

The simulator reuses the frozen production prediction engine
(``elo_boosted_ensemble``) to produce a leakage-safe pregame home-win
probability for every game in a season's schedule, then samples each game's
outcome many times to project each team's win-total distribution and playoff
odds.

Design rules:

* No player-impact or roster-change signal is injected; only the validated
  per-game probability model is used.
* Every probability is formed strictly from information available before that
  game (chronological Elo replay + pregame rolling features), so a season is
  simulated forward in time without leakage.
* Results are validation-driven: the same simulator can replay completed
  seasons (2023-2025) and compare projected win totals and playoff fields
  against actual outcomes.
