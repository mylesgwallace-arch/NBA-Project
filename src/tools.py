"""Deterministic analytical tool layer and orchestration routing.

This module is the stable programmatic surface underneath the future
natural-language AI interface. It exposes the project's *validated* analytical
capabilities as named, parameterized, deterministic tools and routes structured
tool calls to them.

Design rules:

* Every tool wraps an existing validated implementation. Prediction routes to
  the frozen production ``predict_matchup`` (``elo_boosted_ensemble``);
  simulation routes to ``load_pregame_probabilities`` + ``project_season``;
  player diagnostics route to the existing association-only estimates. No new
  model is trained and no prediction/simulation logic is duplicated here.
* The orchestration layer never bypasses the validated production-model path
  and never fabricates answers: it only dispatches to deterministic tools and
  returns their structured output.
* Every result carries the tool name, a description of the operation performed,
  the model/data that produced it, assumptions, limitations, and the actual
  structured result.
* Player-impact diagnostics are preserved strictly as association-only
  estimates. When a diagnostic cannot be produced (no prior history) or is
  low-confidence, the result is marked ``unavailable``/``low_confidence``
  rather than converted into a causal claim.
