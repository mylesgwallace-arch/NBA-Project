"""Focused regression coverage for the deterministic natural-language layer.

The tests verify question -> tool mapping, structured answer rendering that is
derived only from tool envelopes (never fabricated), ambiguity handling, and
pass-through of association-only player-impact language. They use the real
read-only repository database for team/player extraction and monkeypatched
``execute_tool`` so no heavy pipeline runs.
